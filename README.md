# Overview

## Description

This project contains a Tableau Dashboard for a made-up Canadian boutique retail store. The dataset for this project was fabricated for the purpose of quick experimentation and development.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to develop dashboards that a retail company would find useful for their internal analytics and decision making

## Technology

# Tableau

The primary technology used for this project was [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/). Tableau is a powerful Data Visualization tool that enables people to put together clean and concise data visualizations quickly.

An excel file was imported into Tableau and then multiple worksheets were joined for further analysis. 

Several visualizations were made to visualize the companies sales records, geographic performance, and customer demographics, and then formatted into dashboards for easy consumption.

# Results

The visualizations make a few things stand out clearly.

1) This company sales are increasing consistently over the previous two years.
2) A trend of a spike in sales in January is evident.
3) Phones are by far the companies most profitable item.
4) The store located in Halifax, Nova Scotia is the most performant location.
5) Women above the age of 36 are the most profitable customers.

Overall these dashboards could aid the company's team to make better informed and data-driven decisions

Such possible decisions may include

- Ensuring the stores are able to maintain stock of products throughout the year.
- Consider opening another store in the province of Nova Scotia or another maritime location.
- Consider if they should spend marketing material on women above the ages of 36 to attract more profitable. Or if they should re-evaluate their current marketing strategies to attempt to acquire more male customers.
